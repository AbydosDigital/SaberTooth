# Contributing to Sabertooth

### You're awesome!:blush:

Thank you for considering contributing to Sabertooth. Big commitments aren't required. Even small things like grammatical errors in the [docs](https://abydosdigital.github.io/Sabertooth/) really add up. Sabertooth is in its infancy and will need your help to reach its potential. Every contribution is valued and greatly appreciated.

>Following these guidelines helps to communicate that you respect the time of the developers managing and developing this open source project. In return, they should reciprocate that respect in addressing your issue, assessing changes, and helping you finalize your pull requests.

Keep an open mind! Improving documentation, bug triaging, or writing tutorials are all examples of helpful contributions that mean less work for you.

> Sabertooth is an open source project and we love to receive contributions from our community — you! There are numerous ways to contribute, from writing tutorials or blog posts, improving the [documentation](https://abydosdigital.github.io/Sabertooth/), submitting bug reports and feature requests or writing code which can be incorporated into Sabertooth itself.

### Code of Conduct
Please note that this project is released with a [Contributor Code of Conduct](code-of-conduct.md). By participating in this project you agree to abide by its terms.

### Issue Tracker

It's ok to post question on the issue tracker.

Simple fixes, like documentation, don't require that an issue be opened. Simply send the pull request. If you are unsure about it or don't have time to fix it yourself, go ahead and open the issue.

Bugs, enhancements or feature request should be properly labeled. Please remember that not everyone is as experienced and knowledgeable as you. Be thorough in your explanation so that your issue has the best chance of being solved in a timely manner.

### Pull Request

> When woking on large features or bug fixes it's best to split the work(break it down) into different branches/ pull request. This simplifies the process of reviewing and merging.

Requirements for acceptance:
* If it solves an issue it must reference the issue in the title
* New features or methods must have at least basic corresponding test.
* New classes and methods must have documentation(JSDoc comments).
* It must match the coding style of the rest of the project and must pass the linter.
* It must pass the travis-ci build and test(usually).

# Your First Contribution
No worries, we'd love to help you!:thumbsup:

> Unsure where to begin contributing to Sabertooth? You can start by looking through the issue tracker for something simple or maybe read through the [docs](https://abydosdigital.github.io/Sabertooth/) to see if anything needs improvement.

If you're new to Github check out these friendly tutorials:
* [makeapullrequest.com](http://makeapullrequest.com/)
* [firsttimersonly.com](http://www.firsttimersonly.com/)
* [How to Contribute to an Open Source Project on GitHub](https://egghead.io/series/how-to-contribute-to-an-open-source-project-on-github)

At this point, you're ready to make your changes! Feel free to ask for help; everyone is a beginner at first :smile_cat:

If a maintainer asks you to "rebase" your PR, they're saying that a lot of code has changed, and that you need to update your branch so it's easier to merge.

# Getting started

### Follow these instructions and you'll be on your way in no time.:smile:

1. Create your own fork of the code
2. Create a new branch for the fix or feature
3. Do the changes in your fork
4. If you like the change and think the project could use it:
    * Be sure you have followed the code style for the project.
    * Send a pull request describing the changes you've made.


### Small contributions

As a rule of thumb, changes are obvious fixes if they do not introduce any new functionality or creative thinking. As long as the change does not affect functionality, some likely examples include the following:
* Spelling / grammar fixes
* Typo correction, white space and formatting changes
* Comment clean up
* Bug fixes that change default return values or error codes stored in constants
* Adding logging messages or debugging output
* Changes to ‘metadata’ files like Gemfile, .gitignore, build scripts, etc.
* Moving source files from one directory or package to another

# How to report a bug

When filing an issue, make sure to answer these five questions:

1. What version of Sabertooth are you using?
2. What operating system and processor architecture are you using?
3. What did you do?
4. What did you expect to see?
5. What did you see instead?

# How to suggest a feature or enhancement

Sabertooth is an alternative user interface framework for javascript inspired by QT that uses widgets built on [PIXI.js](https://github.com/pixijs/pixi.js) and is rendered with webGL(with canvas fallback). The ability to create custom widgets and styling are the cornerstone of this project.

### Features

>Feature request should only be opened for things that add new functionality to the project.
To suggest a feature, open an issue and try to explain thoroughly why it should be added and how it should work. Please use the feature request label.

### Enhancements

>Only suggest enhancements for things that improve upon existing functionality. To propose an enhancement, open an issue and try to explain thoroughly why it should be added and how it should work. Please use the enhancement label.
